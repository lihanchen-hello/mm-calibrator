# Introduction #

At the moment only install instructions exist for linux. Please see the [Future Development](FutureDevelopment.md) page for details on future plans for porting the project to other platforms such as Windows and MacOS. All dependencies are cross-platform, so in theory porting (even to Windows) should be easy.

To compile the project on your computer, you must have [OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) installed and also the [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries.
